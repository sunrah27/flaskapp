# Python Backend for eCommerce website

A Python project built using Flask framework to act as the backend for my [eCommerce project](https://redstoreapi.onrender.com/). The App connects to a MySQL DB hosted on Aiven and also acts as the server for the API endpoints the eCommerce project uses for Login, Registration, Purchase Histroy and Product data. App also offers a backend to connect to the MySQL DB and update product data.

## Inspiration

During my Introduction to Web Development Bootcamp I learned a lot about front end web development and wanted to put this knowledge to the test. While brain storming ideas for a project I ultimately settled on an eCommerce website. It had all of the features a typical website may have and to test my knowledge as well as fill any gaps I decided to give it go.

As I progressed in my Bootcamp I started off as an experimenting ways to combine my MySQL and Python knowledge together. I wanted to be able to connect to a MySQL DB. From there I began exploring how to perform CRUD operations on the DB using Python. This then grew into creating the logic for a simple Login and Registration functionality. Eventually becoming a complete platform for an eCommerce website supported using API, Python and MySQL Database.
